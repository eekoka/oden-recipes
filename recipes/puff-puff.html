    <p>Puff-puff is deep-fried yeasted dough. This delicious snack is popular in West African cuisine.</p>
    <p>It is commonly served at breakfast or dinner, with fried hot pepper sauce and/or fried beans.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for About 50 Puff-puff Balls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 L Milk</li>
        <li>14 g Fast-acting yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>250 g of sugar</li>
        <li>10 g vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>2 L vegetable oil or other oil for deep frying</li>       
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the dry ingredients (salt, sugar, vanilla sugar, flour, yeast) in a big bowl, pot, or container (5 to 10L) and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and mix with your hands until you get a consistent wet smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Put a lid on the bowl/container and let it stand at room temperature for 4-5 hours for the batter to rise (to about 2X).</li>
        <li>Heat the oil (medium-high setting) in a deep fryer (or deep pot) till the oil is hot enough for frying.</li>
        <li>Mix the batter again with your hands for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Drop small quantities of dough into the hot oil and fry until golden brown. See the technique in the video for dropping batter in oil.</li>
        <li>Fry in batches of 10, 15, or more, depending on the size of your deep fryer or pot.</li>
        <li>Don't make the puff-puff ball too big. The inside of an oversize puff-puff will be undercooked.</li>
        <li>When unsure, open up one puff-puff from the first batch to check that it is well done.</li>
    </ol>
