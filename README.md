Recipes Website Assignment

This is a simple recipe website created for one of my TOP (The Oden Project) assignments.
When this task is done, I would have demonstrated how to create a simple recipe website.
This consists of an index.html page which lists all the recipes. And then a separate
page for each recipe. I would also show that I used Git to push my files to Github.
